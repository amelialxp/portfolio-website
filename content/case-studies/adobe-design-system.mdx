<Problem>
Adobe's enterprise applications were suffering from inconsistent user experiences across different products. Teams were duplicating design work, creating their own components, and struggling with maintenance as the codebase grew.

The lack of a unified design system was causing:
- **Inconsistent user experiences** across different products
- **Duplicated design and development work** across teams
- **Slow product development cycles** due to starting from scratch
- **Poor accessibility compliance** across applications
</Problem>

<Process title="Research & Discovery">
I started by conducting a comprehensive audit of existing Adobe applications to understand the scope of inconsistencies and identify common patterns.

## Stakeholder Interviews
I interviewed 15 designers and developers across different teams to understand their pain points:
- 80% were recreating similar components
- 60% struggled with accessibility compliance
- 90% wanted a centralized design resource

## Component Inventory
I cataloged over 200 unique components across applications, identifying 40 core components that could be standardized.

    }
  ]}
/>

<Process title="Design System Architecture">
Based on my research, I designed a flexible system architecture that could accommodate Adobe's diverse product needs while maintaining consistency.

## Design Tokens
I established a foundation of design tokens covering:
- **Color palettes** with semantic naming
- **Typography scales** optimized for different contexts
- **Spacing systems** based on 8px grid
- **Accessibility standards** built into every component

## Component Hierarchy
I organized components into three tiers:
1. **Foundation** - Basic elements (buttons, inputs, typography)
2. **Composite** - Complex patterns (forms, cards, navigation)
3. **Layout** - Page-level structures (grids, containers)
</Process>

    }
  ]}
/>

<Process title="Implementation & Adoption">
To ensure successful adoption, I worked closely with development teams to create both design and code components simultaneously.

## Figma Component Library
- Created 40+ components with variants and auto-layout
- Established clear naming conventions and documentation
- Built interactive prototyping capabilities

## Development Integration
- Collaborated with engineers on React component implementation
- Ensured design-dev parity through regular reviews
- Created Storybook documentation for easy reference
</Process>

The design system fundamentally changed how Adobe's teams approach product development. Teams report significant time savings and improved collaboration between designers and developers.

## Key Achievements:
- **Reduced design debt** by standardizing components across 8 applications
- **Improved accessibility** with built-in compliance for all components  
- **Enhanced team collaboration** through shared design language
- **Faster onboarding** for new designers and developers
