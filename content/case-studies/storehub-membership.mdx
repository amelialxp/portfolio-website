<Problem>
StoreHub's membership had to work across multiple platforms while maintaining each platform's existing user patterns. The challenge was orchestrating a cohesive experience across:

- **POS checkout flows** where customers could join and redeem rewards
- **Beep mobile ordering** with automatic membership enrollment  
- **QR table ordering** that connected anonymous diners to their membership profiles
- **BackOffice management** where merchants configured their programs

My design strategy was **"complexity behind simplicity"** - leverage our integration advantages while keeping the merchant and customer experience intuitive.
</Problem>

<Process title="Discovery: What do Merchants Actually Want vs Need?">
Through approximately 8 merchant interview visits conducted over a 3-month period, I uncovered insights that shaped the entire design approach.

## Key Research Findings:
- Every merchant we spoke to had a different idea of their ideal membership configuration
- Merchants wanted their members to feel special but were overwhelmed by loyalty program setup complexity  
- Birthday collection was universally desired for targeted campaigns, but merchants feared signup friction

## Critical Insight:
Rather than designing one "best" signup method, merchants needed **multiple enrollment pathways** that matched their specific customer interaction patterns.

<Process title="Design Solution 1: Multiple Enrollment Pathways for Diverse Merchants">
**Problem:** Different merchant types had completely different customer interaction patterns - F&B could use QR ordering, but retail needed POS-based solutions.

**Design approach:** Created multiple enrollment pathways that matched how different merchant types actually interacted with their customers.

## Key Design Decisions:
- **QR ordering auto-enrollment** for F&B merchants using table ordering
- **POS Seamless QR codes** for retail checkout flows  
- **Direct join links** for merchant-specific engagement strategies
- **Receipt QRs** as the final touchpoint for joining so customers can still sign up even after leaving the store
- **Clear membership join source tracking** visible to both merchants and StoreHub

## Impact:
Design enabled diverse enrollment pathways that generated **190,000+ total member signups** across business types, with data showing distinct usage patterns that validate the multi-pathway approach.

<Process title="Design Solution 2: Flexible Reward Architecture Within System Constraints">
**Problem:** Merchants wanted different types of membership programs - points-based systems, cashback, discounts, and free items - but StoreHub's existing promotion system wasn't designed for membership rewards.

**Design approach:** Rather than rebuilding the entire rewards infrastructure, I designed membership rewards to work within the existing promotion framework while hiding the complexity from merchants.

## Key Design Decisions:
- **Four reward types structure:** Welcome reward, birthday reward, points store rewards, and tier upgrade rewards - covering the main merchant use cases discovered in interviews
- **Mandatory welcome reward:** Required merchants to offer signup incentive, ensuring customer value proposition
- **Simplified configuration:** One-click enable with pre-configured defaults, merchants can customize but don't need to understand underlying promotion mechanics
- **Promotion system adaptation:** Mapped membership rewards to existing "amount off" and "percentage off" promotion types with membership-specific constraints

## Design Trade-offs:
Had to limit reward types to work within existing promotion constraints, and merchants still need to navigate to promotion pages for advanced customization - not ideal, but enabled faster launch while improving the existing promo UI along the way.

## Impact:
- Enabled flexible membership programs without rebuilding core systems
- Onboarding consultants could set up merchant programs efficiently using simplified flow
- Merchants could offer both points-based and cashback programs within one system

<Process title="Cross-Functional Design Leadership">
## Becoming the Go-To Design Expert
As the membership system's complexity grew, I became the primary resource for questions across engineering, marketing, sales, and merchant success teams. My deep understanding of every integration point and ability to communicate with our China-based engineering team made me the natural bridge between technical implementation and business needs.

## Design-to-Product Evolution  
When the PM departed, I transitioned to product ownership within two weeks because of my comprehensive system knowledge and established stakeholder relationships. This experience taught me to think beyond interfaces to full product strategy, balancing technical constraints with business priorities.

## What This Really Means
Seeing merchants like Binq and Starwise successfully use the system to reward loyal customers reminds me why this design work matters. Each signup represents a customer who chose to build a relationship with a local business, and our design either enables or blocks that connection.

## Future Opportunities
Through ongoing merchant feedback and data analysis, I've identified key areas for improvement. Malaysian merchants still find the POS QR signup flow unintuitive and limiting, leading to my current work on mobile web parity to reduce app-download friction.

With **9,900+ merchants still not using membership**, there are thousands of businesses we haven't helped yet. Understanding their barriers - whether it's complexity, cost, or simply not knowing the value - drives my continued work on solutions like mobile web signup that remove friction.
